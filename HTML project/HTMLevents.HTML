    As the AAt tanks fire shots at the Gungan sheilds they march their droids towards the front lines of the gungans<br>
    Even though the droids have longer range they are unable to utilize it because of the sheilds<br>
    which force the droids to move within meters of the gungans who are equpped with smaller handheld shields.<br>
    After several hours of fighting the gungans surrender to the droids<br>
    During the battle in the feilds of Naboo Several Noobian pilot hostages were freed by Queen Amidala and her squad<br>
    those pilots would hop into their ships and fly off to fight the droid star fighters and destroy the trade federations blockade<br>
    During the starship battle little Anakin skywalker flies into the and blows up the whole ship causing all ground units<br>
    to shut down all the droids. While all that is happening Obi-wan Kenobi and his master Qui-gon jinn encounter Darth Maul<br>

    confronts the sith Count Dooku and all the jedi reveal themselves to be in the crowd and they all jump into the pit as thousands<br>
    of battle droids flood into the arena all the droids begin shooting at all the jedi and the jedi are cutting through the droids.<br>
    then out of the sky republic gunships land dropping off clone troopers the droids quickly lose the small confrontation and jedi and<br>
    clone troopers pile into gunships and fly off towards the massive sepratist star ships. The ships land and all the clones and jedi<br>
    flood onto the rocky terrain of genosis as dust from the landing gunships fly into the air both sides droids and clone troopers begin<br>
    firing blindly into the dust. as the dust begins to clear sepratist tanks fire armour pericing rounds destroying everything the hit.<br>
    In return the republic clone AT-TE tanks return heavy artillry fire and destroy several droids. In this battle the droids used several<br>
    new tehnology's the galaxy ha never seen before like B-2 Battle Droids, Spider Droids, Dwarf Spider Droids, and Hailfire Droids. As the<br>
    Clones continued to push the droids back through heavy fire they began to set up command posts and AA(anti-air) turetts to counter vulture<br>
    droids and tri-droids even vulture droid bombers. After an hour of battle Count Dooku begins to flee sending the droid army into chaos.<br>
    as Count Dooku runs away he persued by Obi-wan and Anakin. During the pursuit the dorid army begins to leave the planet but in the attempt<br>
