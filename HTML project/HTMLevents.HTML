    In a desperate attempt to save ger home Queen Padme Amidala turns toward the galactic republic for help.<br>
    After being denied she turns to the other society on Naboo<br>
    The Gungans. The Gungans are a species native to the sea of Naboo after political descussions the Gungans agree to help the Naboo<br>
    as the naboo attacked the capital to take the trade federation leaders hostage<br>
    the Gungans divert the droids to the feilds of Naboo where the deadlist battle in this event takes place<br>
    As the AAt tanks fire shots at the Gungan sheilds they march their droids towards the front lines of the gungans<br>
    Even though the droids have longer range they are unable to utilize it because of the sheilds which force the droids<br>
    to move within meters of the gungans who are equpped with smaller handheld shields.<br>
    After several hours of fighting the gungans surrender to the droids. During the battle in the feilds of Naboo Several<br>
    Noobian pilot hostages were freed by Queen Amidala and her squad those pilots would hop into their ships and fly off to<br>
    fight the droid star fighters and destroy the trade federations blockade. During the starship battle little Anakin skywalker<br>
    flies into the and blows up the whole ship causing all ground units to shut down all the droids. While all that is happening<br>
    Obi-wan Kenobi and his master Qui-gon jinn encounter Darth Maul. After Obi-wan and Qui-gon get seperated by sheild genertors,<br>
    Qui-gon is locked in a deul with Maul. Several minutes go by and Obi-wan is still trapped forced to watch his master as Maul<br>
    stuns Qui-gon and stabs him through his intestines. Just then the shield opens and Obi-wan engages Darth Maul. Maul knocks Obi-wan<br>
    down into a deep pit but Obi-wan catches himself on a light and jumps up uses the force to grab Qui-gons light saber flips over<br>

    <h2> the battle of genosis 22 BBY</h2>
    <img src="genosis2.gif" style="height: 300px"><br>
    the Battle of genosis began when Padme Amidala, Anakin Skywalker, and Obi-wan got captured and thrown into an arena<br>
    where they have to fight three dangerous creatures to survive. After they defeated all the creatures Mace windu a jedi master<br>
    confronts the sith Count Dooku and all the jedi reveal themselves to be in the crowd and they all jump into the pit as thousands<br>
    of battle droids flood into the arena all the droids begin shooting at all the jedi and the jedi are cutting through the droids.<br>
    then out of the sky republic gunships land dropping off clone troopers the droids quickly lose the small confrontation and jedi and<br>
    clone troopers pile into gunships and fly off towards the massive sepratist star ships. The ships land and all the clones and jedi<br>
    flood onto the rocky terrain of genosis as dust from the landing gunships fly into the air both sides droids and clone troopers begin<br>
    firing blindly into the dust. as the dust begins to clear sepratist tanks fire armour pericing rounds destroying everything the hit.<br>
    In return the republic clone AT-TE tanks return heavy artillry fire and destroy several droids. In this battle the droids used several<br>
    new tehnology's the galaxy ha never seen before like B-2 Battle Droids, Spider Droids, Dwarf Spider Droids, and Hailfire Droids. As the<br>
    Clones continued to push the droids back through heavy fire they began to set up command posts and AA(anti-air) turetts to counter vulture<br>
    droids and tri-droids even vulture droid bombers. After an hour of battle Count Dooku begins to flee sending the droid army into chaos.<br>
    as Count Dooku runs away he persued by Obi-wan and Anakin. During the pursuit the dorid army begins to leave the planet but in the attempt<br>
    Clone AA turrets focus fire on the massive star ships as they begin to leave the planet surface. During the massive shoot out between the<br>
    Dorids and Clones obi-wan and Anakin pursue Count Dooku when they catch him they engage in a shocking deul as he electocutes obi-wan with<br>
    force lightning and cuts off anakins right hand. Just when it seems like the jedi cannot win Master Yoda shows up and begins to fight the<br>
    sith. When Count Dooku uses his force lightning on him Yoda absorbes the lightning and redirects it. As a distraction Count Dooku attempts<br>
    to crush Anakin and Obi-wan with a peice of debris but yoda catches it but Count Dooku escapes. Although Count Dooku would eventually escape<br>
    this is a massive clone win at the begining of the clone wars.<br><br><br>

    <img src="corusant2.webp" style="height: 300px"><br>
    The battle of corusant was fought rpiamrly in space although there was a seperatist invasion on the planet surface to capture chancellor<br>
    palpatine. The invasion force was primarly a distraction so general Grievous could capture the chancellor and take him aboard the main<br>
    command ship. During the battle Obi-wan and Anakin board the command ship. They have some trouble with the evevator but they make it to<br>
    the top floor where they find the chancellor. Before they can release the chancelor they are confronted by Count Dooku. During the battle<br>
    Obi-wan gets knocked out when he got sent flying into a wall. Shortly after Anakin cuts Count Dookus hands off and holds both light sabers<br>
    to his throat and hesitates weather he should kill him or not. After seconds of holding the lightsabers to the counts throat the chancellor<br>
    says "do it". But it ends up sounding more like "dew it" and Anakin cuts off Dookus head. As the three are escaping they are captured by General<br>
    Grievous and Obi-wan and Anakin are forced to deul Grieviouses guards. During the battle it's discovered that these droids can survive without<br>
    their heads. During this small conflict the battle outside damages the ship causing it to begin to tear apart. As all the droids are escaping<br>
    incuding General Grievous Anakin, Obi-wan and the chancellor attempt to land the ship. As they enter the atmosphere the ship rips in half<br>
    they deploy everything they can to increase drag and land softly.<br><br><br>
